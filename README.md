# Audio-transcription-and-summarization
This script employs OpenAI's Whisper model for audio transcription, Mistral 7B for text summarization, and Gradio for interactivity. It configures the text generation pipeline, defines summarization helper functions, and integrates audio transcription with summarization. It's a powerful tool for interactive text summarization tasks.

# Interactive Text Summarization Tool
This project is an interactive tool that combines the power of various state-of-the-art models for audio transcription, text summarization, and user interaction. It leverages the following technologies:
